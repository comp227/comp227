mandatory</em></strong>.\nWe will be tracking attendance and we have a variety of group exercises that we'll do in class.\nYour presence and engagement directly impact not only your learning experience, but that of your peers.\nWe also need the course time to be able to check in and for me to be able to provide feedback to you all (and vice-versa).\nWhile there will be some asynchronous portions, coming to class will allow me to observe you and provide tips.\nIt will also serve as an opportunity for you to work on exercises and to help each other out in a community fashion.</p>\n<p>You can discuss the course and related topics in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/85rgmTtxHm\">Discord</a> outside of class hours.\nDiscord will have different channels for both your learning partners as well as course-related conversations to help augment class exercises.</p>\n<h3>Pronouns</h3>\n<p>Knowing and applying the names and pronouns that students use is a crucial part of developing a productive learning environment\nthat fosters safety, inclusion, personal dignity, and a sense of belonging across campus.\nPlease let me know your preferred name and pronoun anytime throughout the semester.</p>\n<h3>Grading Scale</h3>\n<p>In this course, we’re experimenting with an <strong><em>ungrading</em></strong> approach.\nInstead of assigning traditional letter or number grades on every assignment,\n<strong>I’ll give you frequent feedback and expect you to reflect on your own growth, as well as to adjust based on that feedback</strong>.\nWe’ll set goals together, discuss how to evaluate your own work, and use feedback (from me and from peers) to track progress.\nAt four different points in the semester, <em>you’ll propose what your final grade would be based on your reflections, effort, and learning milestones</em> that I’ll take into consideration.\nThe aim is to focus on understanding and improvement rather than chasing points.\nWe’ll talk more in class about how this works and answer any questions you have along the way.\nIn terms of how to put your effort in and as a reference this is what I’m expecting to take up most of your time in order:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Individual Exercises</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Social Learning Exercises &#x26; Attendance</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Final Project</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other Activities</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Major Assignments and Examinations</h3>\n<p>The course is composed of a few parts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual Exercises</li>\n<li>Social Learning Exercises</li>\n<li>Final Project</li>\n<li>Other Activities</li>\n<li>Course Exam</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Individual Exercises</h4>\n<p>Part of your assessment for the course will be based on the work you do towards the exercises (including exercises marked with an asterisk).\nFor all of the exercises, your work will not only come from the solution but from you showing your work as you move toward your solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Your assessment will not come just from these exercises</strong>.</p>\n<p>We will be having other exercises and assignments as well that will be just as important to your assessment.</p>\n<p>Know that there are many exercises in this course, and you do not, nor should expect that you need to finish them all.\nHowever, what you provide as evidence of work will be variable, but what is most important here is being able to demonstrate a continual amount of progress regularly each week.\n<strong>You will be expected to demonstrate what you have learned.</strong>\nThis means that if you get stuck during a week, that is OK!\nIf you are unproductive, that is OK too, but means there will be an expectation of trying to improve and to learn from mistakes.\nHow much you can catch up per week will also be capped, to no more than 10% of your average output.\nYou will be expected to work regularly and submit the assignments as listed in Canvas.</p>\n<p>With all submissions requested, please follow submission guidelines carefully.</p>\n<p>Students are responsible for reading course material and following instructions posts on Canvas.\nStudents are also responsible for being aware of any announcements the instructor makes through Canvas and in the course.</p>\n<h4>Course Meetings</h4>\n<p>You must also complete the course meetings and the reflections that lead up to each meeting.\nNotice though that the exam is not listed in your grade breakdown.\nThe exam does not count towards your final grade, but you must pass it to pass the course.\nMore info about the exam will be discussed via Canvas and Discord in the middle of the semester.</p>\n<p>You can only take the exam after submitting a sufficient number of exercises.\nIt is not wise in practice to take the exam immediately after submitting the critical number of exercises.\nThe exam is the same and does not count toward your grade (you just need to pass it).</p>\n<p>If you complete the assignments and you work through the material in earnest, you will be fine on the exam.</p>\n<h4>Late Assignments and Make-up Work</h4>\n<p>The only acceptable excuses for missing an assignment due date are serious illness, death in the immediate family or important professional activities.\nIllness or death in the family may require documentation.\nExcuses for professional activities must be approved by the instructor in advance.\nLate assignments other than the individual exercises will be deducted 15% per day and will not be accepted beyond 1 week late.</p>\n<p>Individual exercises will follow a different policy.\nExercises are broken into Canvas assignments.\nStudents must submit one part before unlocking subsequent parts.\nThere is no late penalty to submit a part.\nHowever, there is a cap on how many individual exercises can be submitted in a given week, to no more than 10% of your average workload.\nYour focus on that point with the individual exercises should be to focus on your current understanding.\nAll work will have a hard cutoff that will be outlined in Canvas.</p>\n<h4>Individual Work and Collaboration</h4>\n<p>Computer professionals usually work in a cooperative environment, yet proper assessment requires that work be done by individuals.\nAI is also beginning to be used quite heavily in full stack development.\nHowever, realize that part of the issue that is being faced is that there may be an over-reliance on AI.\nTo alleviate confusion, the following policy will be followed:</p>\n<p>Collaborative work is encouraged.\nYou can also use AI to help you understand certain lines of code or to use as a partner.\nThis includes students working together on problem sets, planning solution strategies, and helping each other to debug programs.\nCollaboration must stop short of asking to write a program or English that represents your work.\nYou need to make sure that you understand well any work that you submit, as you may be asked to change the code on the fly.</p>\n<p>This policy is not meant to be punitive, but to help you maximize your learning.\nAsk questions to me whenever you are unsure.</p>\n<h3>Collection of Work for Assessment</h3>\n<p>Student work may be retained to assess how course learning objectives are being met, for accreditation purposes, and to provide examples to future students in this course.\nWith COMP 227, all submitted work and electronic activity will be retained for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>assessment</li>\n<li>accreditation, and</li>\n<li>learning how to improve the course for the future</li>\n<li>viewing by future students.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, some of the work may end up being public, as you may end up contributing to repositories that are public (open source) in nature.\nRealize that those platforms <strong><em>will also have records of your activities and contributions</em></strong>.  </p>\n<h3>Honor Code</h3>\n<p>The Honor Code at the University of the Pacific calls upon each student to exhibit a high degree of maturity, responsibility, and personal integrity.\nStudents are expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>act honestly in all matters</li>\n<li>actively encourage academic integrity</li>\n<li>discourage any form of cheating or dishonesty by others</li>\n<li>inform the instructor and appropriate university administrator\nif they have a reasonable and good faith belief and substantial evidence that a violation of the Academic Honesty Policy has occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Violations will be referred to and investigated by the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards.\nIf a student is found responsible, it will be documented as part of her or his permanent academic record.\nA student may receive a range of penalties, including failure of an assignment, failure of the course, suspension, or dismissal from the University.\nThe Academic Honesty Policy is located in Tiger Lore and online at <a href=\"https://www.pacific.edu/student-life/student-conduct/tiger-lore\">https://www.pacific.edu/student-life/student-conduct/tiger-lore</a></p>\n<p>You will be expected to conduct yourself according to professional ethics, just as if this were a real-world job.\nWith this course focused on exercises,\n<strong><em>you may not ask others (including computers) for solutions or to partially solve any of the individual exercises</em></strong>,\nThis also applies to search tools, AI services and other humans, whether hired, friends or classmates.\nYou MAY ask others (both computers and humans)\nfor help understanding particular errors that appear, or in explaining high-level concepts that you feel the text does not explain well.\nHowever, those concepts should not contain the exercise text.\nYou should be able to explain any of the code you write and you also need to cite anything longer than a line of code that you get from the internet.\n<strong>If ChatGPT or other AI services are used, you must be prepared to send me a share link of conversations with the AI</strong>.\nProvide links to any code and tutorials that you find that help you program.<br>\nMake sure to cite and credit code, libraries, videos, ideas, or other resources that are not provided directly from this website.\nHonor code cases will be resolved by an oral examination of the understanding of the material.\njust as a professional would need to credit the source or fully understand code when receiving help from others.\nStudents are expected to participate as a team, with fair credit given according to effort and participation.</p>\n<h3>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h3>\n<p>If you are a student with a disability who requires accommodations,\nplease contact the Director of the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) for information on how to obtain an Accommodations Request Letter.</p>\n<h4>3-Step Accommodation Process</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Student meets with the SSD Director and provides documentation and completes registration forms.</li>\n<li>Student requests accommodation(s) each semester by completing the Request for Accommodations Form.</li>\n<li>Student arranges to meet with his/her professors to discuss the accommodation(s) and to sign the Accommodation Request Letter\nTo ensure timeliness of services, it is preferable that you obtain the accommodation letter(s) from the Office of SSD as early as possible in each term.\nAfter the instructor receives the accommodation letter, please schedule a meeting with the instructor during office hours or some other mutually convenient time to arrange the accommodation(s).\nThe Office of Services for Students with Disabilities is located in the McCaffrey Center, Rm. 137.\nPhone: 209-946-3221.\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:ssd@pacific.edu\">ssd@pacific.edu</a>.\nOnline: <a href=\"http://www.pacific.edu/disabilities\">http://www.pacific.edu/disabilities</a>\nNOTICE: The preceding information is the minimal information required in this section of the course syllabus,\ninstructors are free to expand on the information above and/or add any additional information below.\nSee the requirements below for Program Objectives and Course Schedule.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Academic Support Services</h3>\n<p>Students at University of the Pacific have access to many free support services to help them thrive academically.\nThese services can benefit all students and are designed to help reinforce, extend, enrich and support students’ learning in the classroom.\nBoth students who simply want to improve their performance and those struggling with understanding the material in a course can benefit.\nCome to the academic support center on the second floor of the library for one-on-one or group tutoring appointments,\ndrop-in or by-appointment writing help, math skills lab open hours, research help from academic support librarians, or to sign up for study hall, a study pal or study
